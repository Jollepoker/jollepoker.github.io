There are six different types of layout copmonents:
title, titleLogo, lEmote, rEmote and comment, 
These can be used to fill the schedule.
Rules:
A schedule layout HAS to be accompanied with the scheduled time (Format example: 2024-04-08T16:00:00.000+01:00)
The order of the specified components is not important for the current layout
A schedule can also have different settings set to true for additional display effects
However, only one setting can be used at a time.
A schedule can have another streamer than Nep (twitch only). If nep is the streamer, no streamer should be set.

These are the settings:
discord, glitter, canceled, hideDate

There are no issues in saving mutliple weeks worth of schedule, no matter if the weeks are in the past or the future.

More than 9 streams a week is currently NOT supported.
