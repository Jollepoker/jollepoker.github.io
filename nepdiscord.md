*Neppie might be a little silly and weird but she has good intentions because her ultimate goal is to make you smile! She likes to play all kinds of video games (especially retro and jrpg), is a very skilled artist and dreams of living the idol life! You might see her with lop-type bunny ears sometimes but don't get fooled - those are actually just socks! A master of all crafts, she would rather learn and perfect new skills and do the job herself rather than ask others to do it for her. Her current Minesweeper (Expert difficulty) record is 68 seconds!*

*Former knights whose current forms was created by Neppie. Each one unique and different but all with a strong sense of wanting to protect Neppie's smile and cheer her on in their own way. All are part of Neppie's big family!*

# :paintbrush: Artistry

*Neppie is not only a vtuber but also a professional artist who has been drawing, painting and crafting since an early age! Her signature style takes inspiration from and is reminiscent of 00s moe-type anime art. She usually posts her art on her [@nepnepu_2 art twitter](https://twitter.com/nepnepu_2) account but you might also stumble upon it elsewhere too! She sometimes opens up her [vgen](https://vgen.co/neppienep) for commissions if you're interested! Following is a small showcase of art all made by Neppie!*
